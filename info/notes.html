Nevsky: Implementation Notes</h1>

<hr>

<p>
This implementation and the Nevsky materials on this site are the second edition rules.

<hr>

<p>
Sequence of play changes for expediency:

<ul>
<li> One side does all of Feed, Pay, and Disband before next side.
<li> Russians Feed, Pay, and Disband first after a Russian command card.
<li> One side does both Wastage and Discard before next side.
<li> Loser does all their Ending the Battle steps before the victor.
<li> Crossbow hits are always applied before regular hits when mixed.
</ul>

<hr>

<p>
Why can't I muster Andreas or Rudolf or Knud &amp; Abel?

<p>
Did the Russians play the Dietrich von Gr√ºningen or Valdemar events?

<hr>

<p>
When can I muster Summer Crusaders?

<p>
Summer Crusader vassals muster at the end of the Call to Arms step, after Papal Legate.

<hr>

<p>
When can I use Baltic Sea Trade and Black Sea Trade?

<p>
The Sea Trade abilities give you Coin at the end of the Call to Arms step, after Novgorod Veche.
